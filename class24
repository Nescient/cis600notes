last time we talked about inherent ambiguity.  in logics, there is an inherent ambiguity in most things.  today he will show us another construction that reinforces that concept.

there is an applied/embedded research project about how one might find some workaround in which you might compute some structure.

we are in the bussiness of applied science of finding workarounds.

this will be kind of mathematical.

--------

supposed I have a nonempty set S

take a look at the power set of S (\P^S)

\P^S = { A | A \subset S }

(the set of all subsets of S)

take \F \lteq \P^S  [also let 2^S be the power set as well]

where 

1. \emptyset \not \elementof \F
2. A, B \element \F -> A ^ B \element \F (closed under --finite-- pairwise intersection)
3. A \element \F, A \subset B \subset S -> B \element \F (closed under reverse-inclusion)

\aside{
	b \element B = b is contained in B
	A \subset B = A is included in B
}

EXAMPLE

take S = {a,b,c}

drew a cube.  the hypercube.

{{a,b,c}}

some corners cannot be taken if you want to satisfy the 3 proerties above.

proper filter
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_%28mathematics%29

principal filters are "not too interesting"

drew number line:

<-------------------|------------------>

and added an interval:

<-------------------|-------( . )--------->
                    0         x

\F = { A \subset \R | there are some a, b \element \R     }
                    | such that a<x<b, and (a,b) \subset A}

some other stuff.  stop doing notes to try and understand his examples.

look up proper filters or something.

\N = natural numbers

A \subset \N is cofinite iff \N-A is finite

A \subset B
A\bar is finite
B\bar \subset A\bar

still dont understand it

---------------------------------------------------------------------

\F is a filter (that is proper)

if a filter is not maximal, there will be a set you can add to it and it will still be a filter.

if you have a set that is not in the filter, either:
1. it has non-empty intersection wiht every set in that filter
2. or its compliment is in the filter

suppose A \not \elementof \F

if A does not have not empty intersection with set in \F, then for some B \element \F then A ^ B = \emptyset

what about A compliment (A\bar)?

thus B \subset A\bar

it follows that if you have a maximal filter, every nonempty subset of S will either be in that maximal filter or its compliment will be.

if its maximal, you cannot add anything to it and it already has everything thats not an emptyset, so everything is already in it except for their compliments.

maximal filters go across the power set and take everything or its compliment.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation

imagine an infite array indexed from 0 containing natural numbers.

\aside{
	the difference between a sequence and an array is that you can compute the nth value of a sequence in constant time.

	if the access of the array is dependent on the size of the array, then something something.
}

\F, maximal nonprincipal filter

\aside{any maximal filter on \N must contain all cofinite subsets of \N}

let <n_i> be a sequence of values from i=0 to so-on

<n_i> ~ <m_i> iff {i|n_i=m_i} \element \F

reflexive is that \N is the set above

that is, <n_i> ~ <n_i>

symmetric is <m_i>~<n_i>

transativity

<m_i>~<n_i> AND <n_i>~<k_i> THEN <m_i>~<k_i>

{i|m_i=n_i} \element \F
{i|n_i=k_i} \element \F

so

{i|m_i=k_i} \element \F

because something about the intersection is in the filter

he got an equivalence relationship without using maximality.

--
take the natural numbers crossed an inifinite many times

\N X \N X \N X ....

this would cause infinitly long tuples.

this is a sequence.

missed something

given two equivalence classes.

can you see if you can add them?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class

or multiply them?

[n_i]+[m_i]=[n_i+m_i]

[n`_i]+[m`_i]=[n`_i+m`_i]

if you know the first two are equivalent, does it imply that the last one is equivalent?

<n_i+m_i>~<n`_i+m`_i>

{i|n_i=n`_i} \element \F
{i|m_i=m`_i} \element \F

What about {i|n_i+m_i=n`_i+m`_i} \element \F

addition of the equivalence classes are well defined as is multiplication.

<0>
[0]?

{i|_i=0} \element \F

the standard model of arithmatic

<\N, +, *, 0>

if you have a statement in the language of arithmetic, how do you verify it or something?

ultra power of the standard model of arithmatic

there is nothing you can say in the language of arithmatic that is false on the stardmodel but true in the ultra power (and vice versa)

these ultra powers are elementarily equivalent to their standard models

-----------

you can take touples in the crazy structures and subtract one from it inifintly often.

 <0,1,2,3,4,5,...>
-<0,1,1,1,1,1,...>
 <0,0,1,2,3,4,...>

computable addition for a structure
computable mulitiplication for a structure
but not both at the same time

-------
there is a large class of very hard problems (where solving it you would get a noble prize) that ahve to do with time and space complexity.  satisfiability is NP-complete.  we dont know if there are efficient algorithms to solve NP-complete.

one of the reasons they are difficult is because people developed a huge number of techniques to deal with computability.  these techniques were discovered not to work for these structures.

structural integrity questions in these nonstandard models are easier to solve or something.
