if you flip a coin with a 3/4 probability of heads and 1/4 probabiliyt of tails, how many questions do you need to ask to figure out what the value is?

lets say you flip it 4 times.  now you must think that 3 of them are heads and 1 is tails, but you dont know which ones.  so we are back to the problem of having four possible values and figured out which value is the current one.

arrange it like the tree:

                    /  \
                  /      \
                 /\      /\
                /\/\    /\/\
                ----    ----
               \alpha   \beta, \delta, \gamma

representing it this way, means you have to ask .875 questions:

1*1/4 + 2* 1/4 + 3 *(1/4) = 6/4

well, that doesnt help any....

but if i ask if the tails was in the first two, then ask exactly which one it is, then im down to 3 questions for every 4.  can we do better?
