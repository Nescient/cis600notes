TED TALK!!!!

oh yeah, movies ftw.

------------------------------
dan dennett

philosopher

feb 2003

he does consciousness and other philosophers dont believe it can be explained.

its very hard to change peoples minds.  its hard to change it about consiousness.  because everyone is an expert about consciousness.

this is different than strong opinions.  people think that since they are conscious they are experts on consciousness.


"real magic is not real magic it is tricks.  fake magic is real magic"

the philosopher explains the sawing the lady in half:
the magician does not really saw the the lad in half, he mearly makes you think the person is sawn in half.  youask, how does he do that.  he responds, thats not my department.

showed an image where squares changed colors and some people do not pick up really large changes.  all the squares changed colors.  the eye is constantly in motion.  and if your eye isnt looking at something it is hard to notice anything changes.  its just what your eye is focused on that you can really tell.

amarello paintings have a lot of detail.  or we think they do but when you get close you notice htey are just blobs of paint an dnot real detail

showed two pictures and asked if they were the same shape, only rotated.  did you rotate one and them match them to the other?  how do you know you rotated them?

showing some optical things about how we assume there are boundries where there isnt.  the cube in black dots.

changed the color of the cube but not the surroundings.  this makes boundries go away.

more optical illusions.

talked to us about being able to notice differences, but i dont get what it has to do with consciousness.

another ted talk with david chalmers 2014

march 2014

compares consciouness to movies

we all have a movie in our head right now with sound and smell and feeling and memories and etc

this is consciousness

it is one of the fundamental facts of human existence. there is nothing we know about more directly.

wihtout it our lives would suck but its the most mysterious thing in the universe.

he suggests to integrate consciousness into science. but ppl say you can cus science is objective and consciouness is subjective.

about 20 years ago starting thinking about sconciounesss.  there has been an exploaseion from it.  it has some fundamental limitarions so far.

can we correlate some of our states of the mind and consciouness.  certain things happen in our brain when we see things?  this is still correlation, not explaination.

consciouness is an anomoly.  we need some radical ideas.  one or two ideas that are crazy to figure this out.

one crazy idea is that internal consciouness is an allusion.  we just need to define the behavior of our brain and such to figure it out and that will completely explain it.

this guy doesnt think so.  his idea is that concsciouness is fundamental.  something like physical fundamental laws.

something like charge or mass or osmething like that.  consciounes is a fundamental building block.

the second carzy idea is that consciouness is universal.  eevery system has some degree of consciouness.  pan-psychism.

this might be tied to information processing capacity.

there is a mathmatical theory that does something about information integration.  its called phi.  some math dude.

panphycism might help to integrate something into reality.  physics into reality.  "what puts the fire into the equations" - steve hawkin

there are transcripts of both of these talks on blackboard

/samaside{how do we explain things people do that they are not phiscally able to do?  crazy moms lifing cars off their kids.  retard strength?  how to quantify overloadability.}

are the squares marked a and b the same color?

something about a concept called it from bit

the it from bit image

what this depicts is that the universe is something that is only manafest when it is observed.

what is the universe made of?  not structually (atoms, subatomic particles, etc), but then whats below that and below that.  what is the bottom of the whole?

they are something, but what are they.  his idea is that absolutely everything.

wheelers idea is that literally everything is made of information.

\aside{by simply showing that it is there, is it there?  it becomes there because we know that it is there.}

conscinousness is supposed to arrise from the informational complexity of things.  what science gives us is the mechanical, not the ultimate underlying reality.  it doesnt tell you the nature of the fundamental.

everything is built from the relationships.

chalmers second view is that conciousness arrises from information.

how do little bits of consciouness add up to create sentience?

newmuhsterians?

CALM something about how to get scientific thought or something?

calin mcginn

we are locked into the CALM paradigm.

mathematical symatics of programming language.

antiwholism
