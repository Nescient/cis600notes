drew binary tree again

we can represent each path through the (infinite) binary tree with a sequence of 1s and 0s.

suppose the path 01010101010101...and so forth.  keep zig zagging back through the tree.

take the path 1100110011001100...and so forth.

we can represent these paths through the tree with real numbers in the unit interval.

-------------------
1 = 0.9999 repeating as a hint.
this is equal to \sum from n=1 to \inf of 9 * 10^-n

x = 0.9999

now, what real number is 0.0101 repeating?

lets try 0.142857

---
for 0.0101..., multiply by 4 to move the decimal:
4x = 1.010101...
3x = 1
x = 1/3

how about:
y = 0.11001100....
16y = 1100.1100....
15y = 1100
y = 12/15 = 4/5

------------
therefore, the two paths above are 1/3 and 4/5.  these are events.

to be in an interval of infinite paths, it has to go through some vertex at depth n, it has the probability of (1/2)^n.

the events form the sigma field.

how do we know if a set of paths is an event?

how do we know if something is between the paths?  think of all the paths not between them

think of all the paths to the left of the first interval (0101010101....):

the left paths are:

down two nodes, go to neighbor, down two nodes, go to neighbor, down two nodes....

this continues indefinitely.  every path will go through one of these vertecies if it is not in 01010101....

the first interval is 1/4, then 1/16, then 1/64.  this is powers of 4.  herefore, the probability for all the left intervals is:

\sum from n=1 to \inf of (1/4)^n

x=0.1111111..base4
4x=1.111111...
x=1/3
^--- RIGHT

this
4*? = 4 *\sum
= \sum (4*(1/4)^n)
= \sum (1/4)^{n+1}
= \sum from 0 instead of 1 of (1/4)^n
= 1 + \sum from 1 to inf (1/4)^n
therefore
4*?=1+?
3?=1
? = 1/3

----------------------
now lets do the right of 0.11001100....

go down three to the right, take neighbor and go down one, go down three to the right, take neighbor and go down one, go down three to the right....

1/8, 1/16, 1/128, 1/256, ...

3,4,7,8,

start at 3 and go up by 4
start at 4 and go up by 4

-------------
n0 = 3
n1 = n0+1
n2 = n1+3
n3 = n2+1
n4 = n3+3
...

\sum from k=1 to \inf (1/2)^n_k

going from what we had above, it was 4/5 above.

the interval we have now is 0.00110011...

multiply by 4 to get 0.11001100...
giving us

? = 0.1100 to 0.0011 would be ?/4

thus the interval all the way to the right of 0.11001100 has a probability of 1/5

the union of all events is another event in the sigma field

the compliment of an event is another event in the sigma field

the left is 1/3, the right is 1/5, so what is the probability of being in between?
(14/30 is my guess)

the probability of being outside is 1/3 + 1/5 = 8/15.  the probabilty is 1 - 8/15 is 7/15.

--------------
is a single path an event?
yes, here is why.

.....
if you have a bunch of events, their union is an event:
E0, E1, E2:
\capu from n = 0 to \inf E_n

The compliment is \omega - that \capu

which is equal to

\capintersect from n=0 to \inf (\omega-E_n)

= \capintersetc n = 0 to \inf of F_n (lets call F th ecompliment).

to make it easier, we swap:

........ lots it

what is the probability for the orange path, whihc is the middle two paths (left one, all rights and right one, all lefts)

the probability of a single path is 0.  the probability of a finite number of single paths is 0.

in base 2,
0.01111...=1/2
0.10000...=1/2

this feature of a constant path, where it eventually keeps going in one direction through the vertices,  you will get something like:
0.b1b2b3...bk100000000000
0.b1b2b3...bk011111111111

these two things are equal.

if you have a countably infinite

\aside

http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CountablyInfinite.html
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set

the natural numbers are countably infinite
the real numbers are not countably infinite

\aside

the set of paths in the tree are uncountable, but there is an interesting set of paths in this tree which are countable.

something something

there are exactly two paths for each vertex in the tree that are constant.  (keep going right and keep going left)  the paths that eventually become constant are countably infinite.

countable additivity says if you have a bunch of disjoint events, the unions of those events will have to have the probability that is the sum of all the inididual things or sometihng ... it is 0

if you randomly generate 0s and 1s, the probability that you eventually generate all constants eventually, is 0.


consider the following

functions related to this.  called choice.  takes no inputs and returns a random integer.  and arbitrary integer.  you may have to wait a long time.  guaranteed to return.

flip a coin and if it is heads, add and if it is tails, return the current count.

there is a logical distinction between definately cannot happen and probability 0 can happen.

all the probabilities of all the events are the same if you throw out all the diatic (the ones that eventually become constant) events.



next time, try to have the random walk on the integers done.  there is a combanatorial thing going on.

what does it take for the pebble to be between a and b.  the number of 1s and the number of 0s has to solve some inequality.  and if you reorder it (the hops in a different order), you will still be in the same interval.  with that, you can count all the possible ways to get into the interval.
