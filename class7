if you look at the polynominal wiht the cosine wrapper.  the collection of all such polynominals are called the paremtetric rule space.


say:
a_1 + a_2u + a_3x + a_4v + a_5ux + a_6uv + a_7xv + a_8uxv

8 dimensional rule space.

why is it 8 dimensional space?

vector of values:
[ a_1 ]
[ a_2 ]
[ a_3 ]
[ ... ]


affine subspace?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space

from:

static double poly(double u, double x, double v)
  {
     return binarize(
      // 0.5 - 0.5*Math.cos(Pi*(a + (a+b)*u + (a-b)*v + b*u*v - 2*u*x*v))
         0.5 - 0.5*Math.cos(Pi*(x + v - x*v - u*x*v))

                    );
  }

a_1 = a
a_2u = a+b
a_3x = 0 + 
a_4v = a-b 
a_5ux = 0
a_6uv = b
a_7xv = 0
a_8uxv = -2

[ a ]
[a+b]
[0  ]
[a-b]
[0  ]
[b  ]
[0  ]
[-2 ]

this is what we do now:  map the point [ a ]
                                       [ b ]

this is a two dimensional real space and the standard basis is
[1] and [0]
[0]     [1]

[1 ]       [0]
[1 ]       [1]
[0 ]       [0]
[1 ]       [-1]
[0 ]       [0]
[0 ]       [1]
[0 ]       [0]
[-2]       [-2]

this is a times the first vector and b times the second vector
add the two vectors to get a point in that space

can you make something that makes artificial life?

how do you quantify that:

you have to disturb the value you get from your transition rule.  probably less than 1/5000.  or .0002.

do the structures that self organize reform?  do they have homeostasis?

he did 1/512 change every 10th generation and the stuff reformed.


------------
first thing:  do entropy calculation for each a,b as they vary between -1 and 1.  you have to sample it:

do 40k entropy calculations.  divide each interval from -1 to 0 to 1 into.

a varies from -1 to 1 and vary by 0.001.

to map a colored line from 0 to 1, you could make it grayscale. just find something that looks good and conveys the information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
homework:
calculate the entropy for each polynominal you get where teh coefficients are of the vector form where you vary a and b between -1 and 1 by 0.001.

try to calculate a straight line through the origin that hits interesting entropy and then calculate the leopinov exponent and fine ones near zero or something else.

----------------------
there was a logiscian who refused to serve as a referee after a while.  the referees look at papers coming into a journal and they have to verify it is correct, significant, and new material.

usually you get the paper back and it will be accepted dependent on the changes you have to make.  tarsky would every once in a while get a paper and the principle purpose of a referee was to verify the correctness would take two years.  when blair was in college it would take 3-6 months to get it back for conferences.  notification was a 1 or 2 months before the conference.

jounals would be 12-18 months.  now the turn around is 6-12 weeks.



with rule 110, we have:

a1 = 0
a2 = 0
a3 = 1
a4 = 1
a5 = 0
a6 = 0
a7 = -1
a8 = -1


the values are not going to be 0,1 values.  rule 110 there were only 8 possible variations.  for this, partition this or something.  you need to play with it to figure out how to get the counts of each values.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

the intuition behind shannon entropy si to ask what is the expected value.

how many yes, no questions do you have to ask to determine the value of your random variable.

consider the following:

(a full infinite binary tree)

\aside
suppose we consider the unit interval:
{x \epsilon \reals | 0 \lteq x \lteq 1 }

how many different ways can we put translation invariant probability measures on this space?

imagine the number line:

|------------------------------->R
              |            |
              0            1

Imagine the length (one dimensional area) of a line

take numbers between and what is the length between 1/3 and 2/3?  it is 1/3

image taking a sumbset 0->1/3 and 2/3->1 without the middle.

each is 1/3 and together they are 2/3s.

this is the measure.

every one of these intervals is the same:

a  b
(  )
(  ]
[  )
[  ]

take out the middle third again of each of the two spaces:

now we have 4/9s.  do it again and take out 1/3 of whats left.

what is the pattern?


the first time the whole is split to 2 pices then split to 4 then split to 8.  each piece is 1/(a power of three)
this gives us:
2^n/3^n = (2/3)^n

as n -> \infinity, the limit is 0

but, perhaps we could find a different measure that has more interesting properties.

even if you did this to infinite, there would be points left (we would never loose 0, 1, 1/3, 2/3 for example).  what is left, is every point that in base 3 looks like 0, t_1, t_2, ...t_n where each t_i is {0,2}.

(base 3 is trit expansion)

that each t is either 0 or 2 leads to a binary tree representation where each path is either 0 or 2.

0.022222222222... is take the first 0 then keep taking 2s
this is 2/9 + 2/27 + 2/81 + ....

solve for x where x = 0.02222222222...

3x = 0.222222222222222222...
2x = 0.2

x = 2/3


x = \sum \from i=1 \to \inf of t_i(1/3)^i

what if you gradually let the 1/3 aproach 1/2 continuously.  what do youget then?

change the binary tree to be 0,1 instead of 0,2

b_i = { 0, if t_i > 0 }
      { 1, if t_i = 2 }

\sum \from i=0 \to \inf of b_i(1/2)^i


this has the effect of instead of picking out 1/3 you pick smaller and smaller intervals until you get to 1/2 and now you are picking out nothing.

if you stop this process right before you get to 1/2, then area of what you are taking then is still 0.  but if you craft what you take out carefully, you can make the area you have left anything between 0 and 2/3s.

something about the paths through the binary tree converge to something.  the point you converge to is called a diatic fraction of the form:

m/2^n
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyadic_rational

dyadic fractions have two ways to approximate tehm.

and event is a subset of a probability space.

how do we assign probability to an infinite number of points?  area is the way we do that.  but not everything has an area.  (axium of choice)

we will confine ourselves to events that are subsets of hte unit interval that have defined length (one dimensional area).  how are we goin to come up to that?

we can express them as paths in our infinite binary tree.

if we make the whole tree measure 1, then the ones that go tot he left would be 1/2 and the ones that go to the right would be 1/2.  and then we keep breaking it down.

so we get 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, etc depending onwhich vertex we are looking at.

how do we extend that notion of size measure?

they will have size of 1/2^n.

we find our sets and then close them up under different rules like addition or subtraction or something.

what counts as continuity?

one of the things we need to know is how to continuously map in the right way.


the cantor set.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set

topological spaces?

cantor topology.

next time:
what if we have a biased point and the probability is 3/4 head and 1/4 tails.  we can break the binary tree up to hold this.

what you are left with is that the numbers dont match.  waht is going on?
